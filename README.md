# Cipher-Toolkit
A Java-based console application implementing classical encryption techniques including Caesar, Affine, and Playfair ciphers, built to strengthen cryptography fundamentals for cybersecurity learning.
Classical Cipher Toolkit

A Java-based console application that demonstrates the working principles of classical cryptographic algorithms. This project implements Caesar Cipher, Affine Cipher, and Playfair Cipher with both encryption and decryption functionality through a simple menu-driven interface.

This toolkit was developed as part of my cybersecurity learning journey to strengthen understanding of encryption techniques and their role in secure communication.

## Features

Caesar Cipher (Encrypt / Decrypt)

Affine Cipher (Encrypt / Decrypt with modular inverse handling)

Playfair Cipher (5×5 matrix generation, pair handling, J→I rule)

Menu-driven console interface

No external libraries required

## Tech Stack

Java

Console-based I/O

Core logic implementation (no frameworks)

## Learning Objectives

Understanding classical encryption algorithms

Strengthening programming logic in Java

Applying modular arithmetic in cryptography

Building security-focused projects for portfolio

## How to Run
```bash
javac ClassicalCipherToolkit.java
java ClassicalCipherToolkit
```

## Future Improvements

GUI version (JavaFX / Swing)

File encryption support
